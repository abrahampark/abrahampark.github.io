    <figcaption>Mauna Kea, Hawaii</figcaption>
</figure>
        <p><b>Volcanoes associated with Shield Volcano: Fissure Vents</b></p> <br>
		<p>Shield volcanoes are characterized by their broad, gently sloping profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on 
            the ground. They are primarily built from low-viscosity basaltic lava flows, which travel long distances before 
            solidifying. Eruptions from shield volcanoes are generally non-explosive with
             lava flowing steadily from central vents or fissures. Examples include Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, which 
             were formed by a geologic hotspot (a plume of magma rising from the Earths mantle).</p>

        </figure>
		<h1>Cinder Cone</h1>
        <p><b>Volcanoes associated with Cinder Cone: Scoria Cone and Pyroclastic Cone</b></p> <br>
		<p>Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano, often appearing as steep conical hills with a bowl-shaped crater at the
             summit. They are formed from explosive eruptions of gas-rich magma, which shatters into pyroclastic fragments known as 
             cinders or scoria that accumulate around the vent. These eruptions are typically short-lived but can be violent. 
             Paricutin in Mexico is a famous example, emerging from a cornfield in 1943 and growing rapidly through successive
              eruptions.</p>

        </figure>
         <p><b>Volcanoes associated with Stratovolcano: Complex volcano and Compound Volcano</b></p> <br>
		 <p>Stratovolcanoes are tall, symmetrical cones built up by alternating layers of 
            lava flows, volcanic ash, and other volcanic debris. They are formed by both explosive and effusive eruptions, 
            with viscous lava flows alternating with pyroclastic flows. 
            Stratovolcanoes have steep slopes which give them a more triangular shaped compared to Shield Volcanoes. Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount St. Helens in the United States are classic
             examples of stratovolcanoes. They can also feature multiple subvents of erupting magma away from the main vent.</p>

        </figure>
		<h1>Caldera</h1><br>
		<p>Calderas are large, basin-shaped depressions that form when the summit of a volcano collapses into the emptied magma
             chamber below during a massive eruption. 
             Most calderas are formed by what are called "Supervolcanoes" that can release thousands of cubic kilometers of ash.  Calderas can be several kilometers in diameter and 
             may contain smaller volcanic vents or lakes. An example of a caldera would be the Valles Caldera located in northern New Mexico
            that measures 22 km wide.</p>

		<h1>Volcanic Field</h1>
        <p><b>Volcanoes associated with Volcanic Field: Crater Rows</b></p> <br>
		<p>Volcanic fields, also known as volcanic provinces are areas containing numerous small volcanoes, 
            including both cones and fissures that are spread across a broad region. They often result from localized volcanic activity 
            associated with hotspot activity or plate tectonics. Eruptions within volcanic fields can vary widely in style, 
            from effusive lava flows to explosive eruptions. 
            The Coso Volcanic Field in California is an example of such a volcanic province as it spans over 400 square kilometers and features multiple individual vents.</p>

		<p>Submarine volcanoes are on the ocean floor. They can form along mid-ocean 
            ridges, volcanic island chains, hot spots, or as standalone seamounts. Eruptions at submarine volcanoes can produce pillow 
            lava formations due to rapid cooling of the lava in the cold ocean water.</p>

        <h1>Other</h1>
        <p><b>Other Volcano Types: Maar, Lava Domes, Mud Volcano, etc</b></p>
        <p>Volcanoes that are not associated with previous volcano types.</p> 
        <h3>Maar</h3>
        <p>A volcanic maar is a unique type of volcanic crater formed by explosive eruptions caused by the interaction between magma and groundwater. Maars typically have a low relief and are surrounded by a broad, shallow rim composed of pyroclastic deposits. They are often filled with water, forming lakes known as maars lakes. These volcanic features are common in areas with abundant groundwater and are characterized by their circular shape and steep inner walls. Maars are distinct from other volcanic craters like calderas or cinder cones due to their specific formation process involving phreatomagmatic eruptions.</p>
        <h3>Lava Dome</h3>
        <p>Lava domes are bulbous mounds of lava that form when viscous lava erupts from a volcano and piles up around the vent. Unlike the fast-flowing lava seen in some volcanic eruptions, lava domes are made up of thick, sticky lava that doesn't travel far from the vent before solidifying. This slow-moving lava accumulates around the vent, building up a dome-shaped structure over time. Lava domes can vary in size from just a few meters to several kilometers in diameter, and they often exhibit steep sides and a crater-like depression at the summit. These features can pose hazards, as lava domes can collapse or produce pyroclastic flows during eruptions. Despite their potential dangers, lava domes also provide valuable insights into volcanic activity and the behavior of different types of magma.</p>
        <h3>Mud Volcano</h3>
        <p>A mud volcano is a geological feature where a mixture of water, gases, and sediments is expelled from the Earth's surface. Unlike traditional volcanoes, mud volcanoes eject mud and gases instead of molten rock. They occur in areas with tectonic activity and vary in size from small vents to large mounds. While they're not as hazardous as typical volcanoes, they can still pose risks and provide valuable insights into subsurface geological processes.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="section3_danger" class="container-fluid">
        <h1>Volcanic Danger</h1>
        <p>Volcanic eruptions vary widely in frequency, size, and impact. On average, there are around 50 to 60 eruptions globally each year. Most are small and occur in remote areas, causing little damage or loss of life.
            The severity of eruptions varies. Some cause minimal damage, while others result in widespread devastation. Factors such as eruption size, proximity to populations, and response measures affect the impact.
            Volcanic eruptions typically cause relatively few deaths compared to other natural disasters. However, major eruptions near densely populated areas can have higher death tolls.
            Economic damage varies depending on factors like infrastructure damage and disruption to industries. Major eruptions can result in billions of dollars in damage.
            Overall, while volcanic eruptions can have serious consequences, their impact on human populations is generally lower than some other natural disasters. Communities near active volcanoes must be prepared with effective monitoring and response systems.
            </p>
                    <h3>Threat by Location</h3>
                    <p>Areas with a high concentration of volcanoes often coincide with regions of significant tectonic activity, such as the Pacific Ring of Fire. 
                        Countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, and Chile, located along this belt, host numerous volcanoes. 
                        Understanding the distribution of volcanoes is crucial for comprehensive volcanic hazard assessment and mitigation efforts. 
                        These areas can pose risks to nearby communities through eruptions, gas emissions, and associated hazards like landslides and lahars. 
                        Therefore, monitoring and studying volcanic activity in high-risk regions are essential for effective volcanic hazard management and disaster preparedness.</p>
                    <h3>Threat by Hazard</h3>
                    <p>Volcanic eruptions pose various hazards, each with its associated risks. Ash clouds disrupt air travel and cause respiratory issues as it can build up in a humans lungs like a cement and can cause a victim to suffocate. 
                        Lava flows destroy infrastructure and vegetation. Lahars devastate landscapes and communities downstream. Pyroclastic flows are deadly, caused by ash traveling down the slope of a volcano at high speeds and incenerates everything in its path.
                Different eruptions produce distinct hazards. Explosive eruptions (Cinder Cones, Stratovolcano, and Caldera) results in ash clouds and pyroclastic flows. Effusive eruptions (Shield Volcano) primarily pose risks from lava flows.
                Understanding these hazards is crucial for assessing volcanic risk and implementing mitigation measures. Hazard maps identify vulnerable areas and inform evacuation plans and emergency preparedness efforts.</p>
                    <p>The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) categorizes volcanic eruptions based on their size and explosiveness. 
                        It ranges from 0 to 8, with each increment representing a tenfold increase in eruption intensity. 
                        Small eruptions (VEI 0-2) produce minor explosions and limited ash, while larger eruptions (VEI 3-4) generate significant ash plumes and pyroclastic flows. 
                        Very large (VEI 5) and colossal (VEI 6) eruptions can launch ash clouds into the stratosphere and even impact global climate. 
                        Super colossal eruptions (VEI 7) are rare but catastrophic and can cause global temperatures to fall. Mega colossal eruptions (VEI 8) are the largest eruptions ever recorded and their results can be apocalyptic.
                        VEI 8 eruptions are known as "Super Eruptions," they leave behind massive calders, can blanked much of a continent in ash, and can alter the climate for years. 
                        VEI helps scientists assess volcanic hazards and inform risk management strategies.</p>

        <p>Death Toll: ~2,000</p>
        <p>Info: Europes most famous eruption, 
            the Pyroclastic flows caused by the Volcano destroyed the city of Pompeii.
        The remains of the city and its inhabitants can be seen today in an ash-like mold.</p>

        <p>VEI: 5</p>
        <p>Date: 1980</p>
        <p>Death Toll: 57</p>
        <p>Info: Arguably the msot famous eruption in American history. 
            On May 18, 1980 the northern slope of Mount Saint Helens collapsed, causing a major eruption.
            Pyroclastic flows destroyed hundreds of square miles of land including Spirit Lake.
            The resulting ash cloud rose 24 kilometers into the atmosphere. 
            Snowmelt from the mountains summit created a mudflow called a Lahar that damaged multiple buildings and bridges near the volcano.

        <p>Death Toll: 10,000 (direct) 49,000-90,000 (indirect)</p>
        <p>Info: The eruption released so much ash and sulfur dioxide that it cooled global temperatures. 
            The year after became known as the "year without a summer" 
            as much of Europe and America reported snowfall and winter-like conditions during the summer months.

        <p>VEI: 8</p>
        <p>Date: ~640,000 BC</p>
        <p>Death Toll: N/A</p>
        <p>Info: One of a few documented Super Eruptions, 
            the eruption was over a thousand times larger than Mount Saint Helens 
            and its ash cloud covered much of the modern day Untied States.
            The size of the resulting caldera is comparible to a major city.
            The magma chamber beneath the National Park drives the unique
            geologic activities the region experiences like Geyesers, Hot Springs, Earthquakes, and more.
